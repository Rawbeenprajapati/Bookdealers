    The Sajha BookThela Crew

Let's face it: college textbooks are insanely expensive. And, at the end of the term, the bookstore gives students virtually nothing back for their books. We believe in a better way for students to sell their textbooks quickly, conveniently, and for a fair price. How we do that is by providing an online service to give you cash for your books in three easy steps: 1) get an instant price quote online, 2) and 3) get paid promptly 


We believe in outstanding customer service. That's why our customers get an email response promptly--usually within 24 hrs. Our awesome Customer Care Team is standing by.

We believe that it is important to do things the right way, and to create relationships based on trust. That's why we invite every single customer to leave us feedback on our website, and we work diligently to maintain an excellent feedback score.


If you are looking for someone that you can really count on, give us a try.
